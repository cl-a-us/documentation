# Wanted Recipes

Here's a list of recipes we think we need.
Pick one, implement it, and remove it from the page.
Alternately, add a quick note here for a recipe you'd like to see so someone else can add it.

In the notes below, "JS" means the recipe is just a simple passthrough to an existing JavaScript method.

## Introduction

## Syntax

* Ensuring variables are closed over # with "do"
